# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Searched about lambda in list comprehension and `functools.partial()`.
2. Found How `auto-commit` option works in Django.

**Thoughts** 
1. I realized iterator variable is accessable outside the comprehension 
and `functools.partial()` freezes the evaluation of function's parameters so that
function in list can be called as I intend.
2. I understood why Django recommand to use `auto-commit` as default.
