# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Searched about lambda in list comprehension and `functools.partial()`.

**Thoughts** 
1. I realized iterator variable is accessable outside the comprehension 
and `functools.partial()` freezes the evaluation of function's parameters so that
function in list can be called as I intend.
